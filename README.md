## 💼 About Me

This project was part of my Django learning journey.  
I cloned the base repo, removed unnecessary components, cleaned up the code, and customized it to reflect a functional and focused e-commerce app.

Check out the live demo (once deployed) or explore the codebase to see how it works.
